<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Screenshot](images/screenshot.png)](https://example.com)

Meshtastic is an open-source wireless mesh communication platform designed for long-range and decentralized communication. It allows devices to create a self-configuring mesh network, enabling data transmission over extended distances without relying on traditional infrastructure.

This repository serves as the central hub for the Meshtastic project. It provides firmware, software libraries, and documentation necessary to build, configure, and utilize Meshtastic devices.

<!-- FEATURES -->
## Key Features

- **Long-Range Communication**: Meshtastic utilizes LoRa radios to enable communication over extended distances, reaching several kilometers in optimal conditions.
- **Mesh Networking**: Devices form a mesh network where messages can be routed through multiple hops, ensuring robust connectivity even in challenging environments.
- **GPS Positioning**: Each device can determine its GPS coordinates and share them with other devices, enabling real-time location tracking and mapping within the network.
- **Text Messaging**: Meshtastic devices support text messaging, allowing individuals within the mesh network to communicate with each other via simple chat-like messages.
- **Offline Maps**: The platform supports offline maps, allowing users to visualize the position of other devices on their own devices without requiring an internet connection.
- **Open-Source**: The entire Meshtastic project, including firmware, libraries, and documentation, is open-source, fostering community contributions and customization.
